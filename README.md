# docker-ds
[WIP] Personal docker environment for data science

## Installation

Currently the images are not available on Docker Hub but soon they will be.

## Usage

There are two images available:

### CPU

#### To build CPU image

```sh
$ docker-compose --file docker-compose.cpu.yml build
```

#### To run container with CPU image

```sh
$ docker-compose --file docker-compose.cpu.yml run --service-ports datascience
```

### GPU

#### To build GPU image

```sh
$ docker-compose --file docker-compose.gpu.yml build
```

### To run container with GPU image

Currently `docker-compose` does not support [runtime in file version `3`](https://github.com/docker/compose/pull/5405). Hence docker-compose file version used is `2.3`.

```sh
$ docker-compose --file docker-compose.gpu.yml run --service-ports datascience
```

## Note:

If you're using `docker-compose` from this project, please do not forget to create `.env` file using [`.env.sample`](https://github.com/ManrajGrover/docker-ds/blob/master/.env.sample) file.
